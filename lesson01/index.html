    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class ="lead"> My name is Quynh Nguyen. I'm a 3rd year at Mesa College and my major is Game Design and Development. I want to take Web Development
        classes because I want to create my own webpage to display portfolio of my project in the past which 
        includes some of the prototype and game design/ideas. 
    </p>
    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <p class="lead">I took some coding classes including in Javascript, C++ and right now, I'm taking classes for Python.
        All the classes I took are beginning level since I'm still trying to learn and practice coding on my own
        time. Since only Javascript would be helpful for this class but I do hope the other coding classes will also
        be helpful for web dev class.
    </p>
    <h2>What do I want to learn</h2>
    <p class="lead" >There is a lot of things to learn for web dev, I'm not sure if graphic design class will be helpful for 
        web dev class since it's related more to design but I hope this intermediate class will help me improve my
        coding for web dev. In the end of the course, I hope to learn:
       <ul class="a">
            <li> Code faster and more efficient</li>
            <li> Know more emmet shortcut so that I can keep my html file neat, clean and organized</li>
            <li> Be able to apply what I learned to perform web design skill in real life</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
