          <p> My name is Quynh Nguyen. I'm a 3rd year at Mesa College and my major is Game Design and Development. I want to take Web Development
            classes because I want to create my own webpage to display portfolio of my project in the past which 
            includes some of the prototype and game design/ideas.</p>

          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>I took some coding classes including in Javascript, C++ and right now, I'm taking classes for Python.
              All the classes I took are beginning level since I'm still trying to learn and practice coding on my own
              time. Since only Javascript would be helpful for this class but I do hope the other coding classes will also
              be helpful for web dev class.</p>

            <p>There is a lot of things to learn for web dev, I'm not sure if graphic design class will be helpful for 
              web dev class since it's related more to design but I hope this intermediate class will help me improve my
              coding for web dev. In the end of the course, I hope to learn:</p>
